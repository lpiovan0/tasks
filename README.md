- db_tasks.ipynb : Notebook with basic tasks related to the new release (1300) of the MICrONs dataset. Neurons from particular layers, types and proofreading statuses are extracted. A connectivity table is computed. Currently has a dsyfunctional cell with a computationally heavy query attempting to retreive all neurons projecting onto L2/3 regardless of proofreading status.
